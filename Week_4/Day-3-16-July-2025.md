### 2. Props (Properties)
What it is:
Props are inputs to components. They allow you to pass data from parent to child.

Example:
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h2>Hello, {props.name}!</h2>;
}

React HOOKs 
1. useEffect Hook
ðŸ”¹ What it is:
useEffect lets you run side effects in your components (e.g., API calls, setting up listeners, timers).

ðŸ”¹ When it runs:

After the component mounts

After every re-render (if not given a dependency array)

Only when certain state/props change (if dependencies are passed)

ðŸ”¹ Example:
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component mounted or count changed:", count);
  }, [count]); // Runs whenever 'count' changes

  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click {count}</button>;
}
