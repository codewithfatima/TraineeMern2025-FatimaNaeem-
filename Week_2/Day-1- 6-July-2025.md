### Week 3: Scripting Javascript Fundamentals
In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to the object that is currently executing the function. Its value depends on how a function is called, not where it is defined.

this Inside a Method (Object Function)
const person = {

name : “fatima”,

greet:function(){

console.log(this.name);
}
}

person.greet();

2. Alone in a Function (Non-Strict Mode)
function show() {
console.log(this);
}

show();

3. In an Event Listener
**

Click me

const obj = {
name: “Fatima”,
greet: () => {
console.log(this.name);
}
};
obj.greet();

4 . In Global Scope**
console.log(this)

Tip to Remember:
"this always refers to how the function is called, not where it is written."
