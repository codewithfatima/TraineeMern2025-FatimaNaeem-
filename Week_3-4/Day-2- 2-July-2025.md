### 📘 JavaScript Crash Course – Week 3 (Theory Notes)

> A focused summary of concepts: loops, arrays, functions, conditions, objects, and more. No code – only what matters.

---

## ✅ 1. Conditions in JavaScript

- **if / else**: Used to execute blocks of code based on true/false conditions.
- **Ternary Operator**: A shortcut way to write simple if/else (uses `? :`).
- Important: Conditions allow your program to make decisions and change flow.

---

## 🧠 2. The `checked` Property (HTML Forms)

- Used to check if a **checkbox** or **radio button** is selected.
- It's a boolean (`true` / `false`) value.
- Helps create dynamic form-based interactions.

---

## 🔁 3. Loops

- **Loops** allow repeating actions or instructions.
- Common types:
  - `for` loop – known number of repetitions.
  - `while` loop – repeats while a condition is true.
  - `do...while` – runs at least once, then repeats.

### Why Loops Matter:
- Avoids repeating code manually.
- Useful for working with data, arrays, and automations.

## 🔄 4. Top-Down and Iterative Thinking

- **Top-Down**: Breaking big problems into smaller steps logically.
- **Iteration**: Repeating tasks to solve or build something over time.
- Important for solving real-world problems with code.

---

## 📚 5. Arrays

- Arrays store **multiple values in one variable**.
- Elements are ordered and indexed.
- Often used in loops, data storage, and list management.

---

## 🔧 6. Functions

- Functions are **reusable blocks of logic**.
- They take inputs (parameters), do something, and may return a result.
- They help organize and avoid repeating code.

---

## ➡️ 7. Arrow Functions

- A **shorter syntax** for writing functions.
- They behave differently with `this` keyword (inherit from parent scope).
- Used widely in modern JavaScript for cleaner code.

---

## 🔁 8. Function Borrowing

- One object uses a function from another object.
- Allows **code reuse** and **dynamic context binding**.
- Often done using methods like `.call()` or `.apply()`.

---

## 🧱 9. JavaScript Objects

- Objects group related **data (properties)** and **functions (methods)**.
- Represent real-world things like users, cars, or items.
- Everything in JS is almost an object (except primitives).

---

## 🎯 10. Primitive Data Types (What Matters)

- Types that are **not objects** and have no methods:
  - `String`
  - `Number`
  - `Boolean`
  - `Undefined`
  - `Null`
  - `Symbol`
  - `BigInt`
- Primitives are immutable and stored by value.
